We give an algorithm which solves this problem to additive $\u03b5$ with $\\tilde{O}(1/\u03b5)$ parallel depth, and $\\tilde{O}\\left(n^2/\u03b5\\right)$ work. Barring a breakthrough on a long-standing algorithmic open problem, this is optimal for first-order methods. Blanchet et. al. '18, Quanrud '19 obtained similar runtimes through reductions to positive linear programming and matrix scaling. However, these reduction-based algorithms use complicated subroutines which may be deemed impractical due to requiring solvers for second-order iterations (matrix scaling) or non-parallelizability (positive LP). The fastest practical algorithms run in time $\\tilde{O}(\\min(n^2 / \u03b5^2, n^{2.5} / \u03b5))$ (Dvurechensky et. al. '18, Lin et. al. '19). We bridge this gap by providing a parallel, first-order, $\\tilde{O}(1/\u03b5)$ iteration algorithm without worse dependence on dimension, and provide preliminary experimental evidence that our algorithm may enjoy improved practical performance. We obtain this runtime via a primal-dual extragradient method, motivated by recent theoretical improvements to maximum flow (Sherman '17).", "categories": ["cs.DS", "cs.LG", "math.OC", "stat.CO", "stat.ML"], "arxiv_id": "1906.00618v1"}, "description": "TODO", "variables": "TODO", "embeddings": "TODO"}
