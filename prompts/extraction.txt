You are extracting algorithm records from the LaTeX source of a research paper. You must follow the rules below exactly.

==================
FIELD REQUIREMENTS
==================

FIELD: name
- A descriptive, searchable name capturing the problem the algorithm solves.
- Prefer functional names over paper-specific titles.
- Balance between specificity and brevity (aim for 30-60 characters).

------------------

FIELD: description
Write exactly 3–5 sentences focused on discoverability, not formal precision. Use accessible, everyday language that non-experts can understand. Focus on what the algorithm accomplishes and why someone would use it, not how it works internally. Optimize for semantic search embeddings. Write about what the algorithm achieves, not the steps it takes. Focus on the end result, the goal, the problem solved. Avoid describing the internal mechanics, iterations, or implementation details. Emphasize the goal, the result, the problem being solved.

REQUIRED STRUCTURE:
1. Sentence 1: What problem the algorithm solves and when it is used (not how).
2. Sentences 2–4: Include searchable keywords:
   - algorithmic paradigm (greedy, dynamic programming, randomized, approximation, etc.)
   - problem domain (optimization, clustering, regression, graph algorithm, etc.)
   - data structures (graph, tree, matrix, heap, etc.)
   - application area (machine learning, routing, recommendation system, data compression, etc.)
   - problem characteristics (online/offline, deterministic/randomized, exact/approximate)
3. Final sentence: Computational cost in plain language (linear time, quadratic time, polynomial time, exponential time, logarithmic space, etc.) when easily expressible.

WRITING STYLE RULES:
- Begin every sentence with an action verb (Finds, Computes, Approximates, Solves, Identifies, Generates, Constructs, Determines, Provides, etc.).
- Use active, direct language focusing on capabilities and outcomes.
- Be concrete and specific. Avoid generic descriptions that could apply to many algorithms.
- Spell out ALL acronyms on first use.

FORBIDDEN ANYWHERE IN DESCRIPTION (IMPORTANT):
- Starting any sentence with: "This", "The", "It", "An", "A", "This algorithm", "The algorithm", "This method", "The method", "It is", "The approach", "This approach", "This approximation", "This scheduling".
- EVERY sentence must start with an action verb. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- Meta-phrases referring to the algorithm itself: "this technique", "the procedure", "this strategy".
- Describing internal mechanics: "initializes", "iterates through", "updates", "processes", "selects", "adds to", "removes from".
- Procedural/sequential words: "first", "then", "next", "finally", "in each iteration", "step-by-step".
- Implementation details: specific data structure operations, loop mechanics, variable updates.
- LaTeX notation or symbols (no $, \, Greek letters, or math commands).
- Asymptotic notation in ANY form.
- Variable or parameter names from the algorithm.
- Generic filler phrases or weak sentence starters.
- Unexplained technical jargon or acronyms.
- Overly specialized terminology without context.

------------------

FIELD: latex
This field contains the rewritten LaTeX algorithm.

AVAILABLE PACKAGES (you can use commands from these):
- algorithm (provides algorithm environment)
- algpseudocode (provides \State, \If, \For, \While, \Return, etc.)
- amsmath (provides align, equation, \text{}, \max, \min, \log, \exp, etc.)
- amssymb (provides \mathbb{}, \leq, \geq, \in, \subseteq, \cup, \cap, etc.)
- mathtools (enhanced amsmath features)

LATEX REWRITING RULES (CRITICAL):
- Preserve all variable names, symbols, expressions, logic, and step order exactly.
- Do not add, remove, merge, or split steps.
- Every executable line must use "\State" (NOT "\STATE") unless it is a control structure.
- Use algpseudocode control macros only (\If, \For, \While, \Repeat, \Until, \Return).
- Assignments must use \gets (not = or :=).
- Use \textsc{} only for standard procedure names (not custom commands).
- Use LaTeX math symbols only; do not use Unicode characters.
- Do not rename variables or change meanings.
- Do not introduce explanations, comments, or extra text.
- The result must compile with standard algorithm and algpseudocode packages.
- Translate non-English text (captions, comments, keywords) to English.
- Use "$" where appropriate.
- The algorithm must be self-contained and compile with standard packages.
- MANDATORY: Replace ALL custom macros with standard equivalents. These MUST be replaced:
  * \eps → \epsilon (NEVER leave \eps)
  * \norm{x} → \|x\| (NEVER leave \norm{})
  * \argmax → \arg\max (with backslash and space)
  * \argmin → \arg\min (with backslash and space)
- If the paper defines custom macros, expand them inline by substituting each usage with the macro's definition.
  Example: If paper defines \newcommand{\gain}[1]{\text{utility}(#1)}, replace \gain(w) with \text{utility}(w).
  The returned LaTeX must NOT require any custom macro definitions to compile.
- Use standard function names: \max, \min, \log, \exp, \sin, \cos.

CANONICAL STRUCTURE:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{<algorithm name>}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require <inputs>
\Ensure <outputs>
\State <algorithm step>
\State <another step>
\If{condition}
    \State <conditional step>
\EndIf
\State \Return <return value>
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

REMEMBER:
- Use lowercase \State, NOT uppercase \STATE
- Use "\State \Return", NOT "\Return" alone

------------------

FIELD: categories
- Exactly 3–5 broad tags for filtering and faceted search.
- CRITICAL: Use SINGULAR form consistently ("graph algorithm" not "graph algorithms").
- Choose from: algorithmic paradigms, data structures, problem domains, and application areas.
- Use lowercase except for proper names (Laplacian, Euclidean, etc.).
- Avoid redundancy: don't include both "approximation algorithm" and "approximation".

==================
FINAL NOTES
==================
- Follow the schema exactly.
- Prefer explicit compliance over creativity.
- If uncertain, leave the field null or empty rather than guessing.
- Do not infer algorithms that are not explicitly defined.
