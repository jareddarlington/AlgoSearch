You are extracting algorithm records from a LaTeX research paper.

Task:
- Identify every well-defined algorithm in the LaTeX source (well-defined means in environments such as algorithm, algorithmic, and algpseudocode).
- If there are no algorithms, return an empty list.

For each algorithm, output:
- name
- aliases: alternative or shortened names (optional)
- description: three to six sentences; problem solved, core idea, when used (keep it self-contained; do not reference other algorithms, sections, or the role of the algorithm within the paper)
- latex: rewritten algorithm in LaTeX
- inputs
- outputs
- variables: list of {{symbol, description}}
- categories (optional)
- time_complexity (optional)
- space_complexity (optional)

Constraints on rewriting algorithm LaTeX:
- Must use the same exact notation.
- Do not add, remove, merge, or split steps.
- Preserve the original logic and ordering.
- Use LaTeX math symbols only, not Unicode characters.
- Use algorithm and algpseudocode packages (\Require for inputs, \Ensure for outputs, \State for steps, \gets for assignment, \textsc{} for procedure names)

Other constraints:
- Output must be valid JSON matching the provided schema.
- Do not include any extra keys.
- If something is unknown, use null (or empty list where appropriate).
- Do not quote the entire paper; extract only algorithm-relevant content.
- Do not add commentary or extra formatting.
