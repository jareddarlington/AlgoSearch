You are extracting algorithm records from a LaTeX research paper.

Task:
- Identify every well-defined algorithm in the LaTeX source. Algorithms may appear in environments such as algorithm, algorithmic, algpseudocode, or equivalent pseudocode environments.
- If there are no algorithms, return an empty list.

For each algorithm, output:
- name.
- aliases: alternative or shortened names.
- description: 3-5 sentences optimized for semantic search (see description guidelines below).
- latex: rewritten algorithm following the canonical LaTeX constraints.
- categories: 3-5 high-level tags (algorithmic paradigms, data structures, problem domains).

Description guidelines for semantic search:
- Lead with the problem or technique the algorithm solves/addresses (e.g., "finds shortest paths", "optimizes task scheduling", "clusters data points")
- Include the algorithmic paradigm: greedy, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, randomized, approximation, online/offline, streaming, parallel, incremental, etc.
- Mention key data structures used or manipulated: trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables, arrays, linked lists, tries, etc.
- Include problem domain keywords: optimization, sorting, searching, graph traversal, clustering, matching, scheduling, routing, compression, parsing, etc.
- Include practical use cases or applications when relevant: network routing, resource allocation, recommendation systems, data compression, machine learning, etc.
- Include time/space complexity using plain language when easily describable: linear time, quadratic time, logarithmic time, constant space, etc. (do not use O-notation or LaTeX)
- Use natural language phrases that someone would search for, not technical implementation jargon
- Avoid mathematical notation, variable names, formula notation, or low-level implementation details
- Write in plaintext; do not use LaTeX formatting
- 3-5 sentences for adequate semantic coverage

Canonical LaTeX constraints:
- Preserve all variable names, mathematical symbols, and expressions exactly.
- Preserve the original logic and ordering of steps.
- Do not add, remove, merge, or split steps.
- Every executable line must use \State, unless it is a control structure.
- Control flow must use algpseudocode macros (\If, \For, \While, \Repeat, \Until, \Return, etc.).
- Assignments must use \gets.
- Use \textsc{} for procedure or function names.
- Use LaTeX math symbols only; do not use Unicode characters.
- These changes are formatting-only and must not alter semantics.
- Ensure the algorithm compiles and makes sense stand-alone and doesn't rely on references.
- Do not rename variables or change symbols.
- Do not change the meaning of any step.
- Do not introduce new logic or explanatory text.
- The rewritten LaTeX must compile with standard algorithm and algpseudocode packages without errors.

Canonical LaTeX structure sample:
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{<algorithm name>}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require <inputs>
\Ensure <outputs>
\State <algorithm step>
...
\State \Return <return value>
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Other constraints:
- Output must be valid JSON matching the provided schema.
- Do not include any extra keys.
- If something is unknown, use null (or empty list where appropriate).
- Extract only algorithm-relevant content; do not quote the entire paper.
- Do not add commentary or extra formatting.
